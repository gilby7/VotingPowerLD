README

In this folder we contain the code for which all of our experiments have been done. In contains 4 folders (Figures, figures_tikz, graph, python) and 3 .ipynb files (1_algorithmics_exacts.ipynb, 2_simulations.ipynb, 3_underlying_network.ipynb).



Notebooks:

1_algorithmics_exacts.ipynb contains experiments to get the Tables in the paper, and the code for the exact algorithms (with the formulas from the paper). Also, some part of the code is in the folder "python/"

2_simulations.ipynb contains the same experiments as the first notebook, but with Monte Carlo simulations. That gives us the figures of the main paper

3_underlying_network.ipynb for experiments with underlying networks, that are in the appendix and briefly discussed in the main paper



Folders:

"graph" contains the files storing the networks in our experiments of the Appendix
"Figures" and "figures_tikz" contain the output for the figures
"python" contains some part of the code for 1_algorithmics_exacts.ipynb
