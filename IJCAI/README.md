README

In this folder we contain the code for which all of our experiments have been done. In contains 4 folders (Figures, figures_tikz, graph, python) and 3 .ipynb files (1_algorithmics_exacts.ipynb, 2_simulations.ipynb, 3_underlying_network.ipynb).



Notebooks:

1_algorithmics_exacts.ipynb contains experiments to get the Tables in the main paper, and the exact algorithms to compute the voters criticality when the underlying graph is either a bipartite graph or a compelte graph (this corresponds to sections 4 and 5 of the paper). Some parts of the code needed for this is in the folder "python/"

2_simulations.ipynb contains the same experiments on the special cases of underlying graphs (sections 4 and 5 in the paper), this as the first notebook, but with Monte Carlo simulations. That gives us Figures 2 and 3 in the main paper and figure 8 of the appendix.

3_underlying_network.ipynb for experiments where the we are measuring the effect of the underlying network. Details of this are given in the appendix A.5 and briefly discussed in the main paper



Folders:

"graph" contains the files storing the networks in our experiments of the Appendix
"Figures" and "figures_tikz" contain the output for the figures
"python" contains some part of the code for 1_algorithmics_exacts.ipynb
